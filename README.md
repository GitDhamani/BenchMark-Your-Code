# BenchMark-Your-Code
Test How Long your Code takes to Execute, so you can Improve Efficiency.

A good way to check your understanding of how your Algorithm works is to benchmark it and see how long it takes to execute. You can use profiling tools to do this which come with your IDE. However here is a quick and dirty method to get a pretty fine resolution timer that will tell you how long your Algorithm takes to execute. You just place your code into the template. It relies on a timer being created when the function is called and it is stopped when the object is destroyed, giving you an interval of time that measures how long your code executed for.
